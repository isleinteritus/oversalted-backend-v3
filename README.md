# oversalted-backend-v3

---
overSalted's goal is to provide a global community for people whom cook as a way to troubleshoot certain 
issues in their cooking. Basically it is like having your elders around that doesn't hit you because you did the thing again.

If interested in the technical aspects of overSalted please head over to the documentation folder as I tend to sort 
things out there rather than here.
